# Image Comparer

## **What this program is about?**
  * This simple python program can compare two image files and can display the differences between the two images in an interactive window. 
 
## **Install:**
  1. Download "Image_Comparer.py" file and the "config.txt" file.
  2. Place both files in a new folder. 
  3. Ensure all libraries are installed from the "requirements.txt" file.
     - If not type ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in a python terminal to install the required python libraries.
     - If all the libraries are installed, then the program can be ran.


## **How to use:**
  1. Run the .py file in a command prompt or terminal. 
 
  2. Select one of the options: Start or Settings 
     - Start: Runs the program and prompts the user for input.
     - Settings: Allows the user to change various settings such as changing the color of the displayed images or changing what parts of the images are         highlighted. 
    
  3. Once the program is ran it will ask for the file path of two image files. Files can be either draged and droped into the command line or the file path for the images can be typed in.
       - **Both images must be of the same resolution or the program will be unable to display the 2 images side by side.**
       - **The program can still compare the images in text only mode if the source image resoultion does not match the resolution of the target image.**
  
  4. The program will scan both images and compare the images. This process may take a few minutes, depending on the resoultion of the selected images.
 
  5. Once the program is finished comparing the images, it will display an interactive window with both of the images side by side. The 2nd image will have a color filter applied to highlight the sections that differ from the source image.
 
  6. To close the program either press any key or click on the close button on the window.
